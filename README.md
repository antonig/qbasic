PERIOTBL.BAS Draws the Periodic Table of the Elements in SCREEN12. Uses a great print routine with multiple fonts made by E.F.Deel back in 1993, to which i have added several options .  I use too a set of DATA for the elements properties from a code by Dieter Folger (2003) . I found both at the ABC Packets. 
CALEND2.BAS  A perpetual calendar (Gregorian). Prints the year you choose. Month and weekday names in DATA so it's easy to add more (now es,fr, en). A constant allows to choose print weeks starting in sunday. The program reads the events you set for the year and displays them. 6 colors for events. Events can be a single year, every year, every month and the nt'h monday...sunday) of a mont h or each month.
