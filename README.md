I was active in the QBasic scene 20 years ago. After retiring from work I have intalled DOSBox in my Win10 computer, got a copy of QB4.5 and I'm back into fun. I will start to like QB64 the day it starts to do executables smaller than 100 Kb....

PERIOTBL.BAS Draws the Periodic Table of the Elements in SCREEN12. Uses a great print routine with multiple fonts made by E.F.Deel back in 1993, to which i have added several options .  I use too a set of DATA for the elements properties from a code by Dieter Folger (2003) . I found both at the ABC Packets. 

CALEND2.BAS  A perpetual calendar (Gregorian). Prints the year you choose. Month and weekday names in DATA so it's easy to add more (now es,fr, en). A constant allows to choose print weeks starting in sunday. The program reads the events you set for the year and displays them. 6 colors for events. Events can be a single year, every year, every month and the nt'h monday...sunday) of a month or each month. 

VIAJANTE.BAS This is a demo of the travelling salesman problem. The solving algorithm was posted by Alberto Migliorero. I made place for up to 240 cities, improved the visualization and added an initialization that joins each city with the closest not visites and makes the algoritthm's life easier.The original random initialization is funnier to watch.

MELINDA.BAS A different way to display the Mandelbrot set, discovered by Melinda Green in 1993, it accumulates the intermediate values of the points where the series diverges. It's an old SCREEN13 code that does zillions of iterations, after a couple of minutes appears an image that suggests a person meditating in the lotus position. The original name given by Melinda to the image is nowadays non-PC.
