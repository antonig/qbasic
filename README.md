PERIOTBL.BAS Draws the Periodic Table of the Elements in SCREEN12. Uses a great print routine with multiple fonts made by E.F.Deel back in 1993, to which i have added several options .  I use too a set of DATA for the elements properties from a code by Dieter Folger (2003) . I found both at the ABC Packets.
